{"name":"sue","version":"0.2.0","author":"Akito <the@akito.ooo>","desc":"Executes a program as a user different from the user running `sue`. The target program is `exec`'ed which means, that it replaces the `sue` process you are using to run the target program. This simulates native tools like `su` and `sudo` and uses the same low-level POSIX tools to achieve that, but eliminates common issues that usually arise, when using those native tools.","license":"GPL-3.0-or-later","skipDirs":["tasks"],"skipFiles":["README.md"],"skipExt":["nim","nim"],"installDirs":[],"installFiles":[],"installExt":[],"requires":[{"name":"nim","str":">= 1.2.6","ver":{"kind":"verEqLater","ver":"1.2.6"}},{"name":"regex","str":">= 0.16.2","ver":{"kind":"verEqLater","ver":"0.16.2"}}],"bin":["sue"],"binDir":"","srcDir":"src","backend":"c","ref":"refs/heads/master"}
